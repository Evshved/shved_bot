### Hi. It's bot app. This app based on gem 'gem 'telegram-bot-ruby''
Tests how it's work with gem 'foreman'. Not use rspec, because I don't know why.
I want to build this bot on Telegram with Webhooks.
I freeze the project until better times.
Probably the bot can be connecting to the project 'Bsuir Organizer'.
